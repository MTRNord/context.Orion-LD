--NAME--
parseArgs complains about bool argument with a value

--SHELL-INIT--

--SHELL--
#
# -multiservice is a valid BOOLEAN parameter for the broker.
# As the parseArgs library allows for space or no space between the name of an option
# and its value (-x1 == -x 1), -multiserviceXXX is the bool option -multiservice WITH a
# value of XXX, which is an error, as bool options have no values.
# This error should be printed on stdout, like:
#
# -multiservice: bool option - no value allowed
#
$BROKER -multiservice XXX

--REGEXPECT--
parameter 'XXX' not recognized
